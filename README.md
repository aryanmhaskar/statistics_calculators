Calculators to help with boring statistics operations that take forever.
The full_stat_calc.py is capable of calculating both DESCRIPTIVE AND INFERENTIAL statistics. All ou have to do is enter the data points for each set. Formats for direct copy-paste
However, if you only need to do descriptive statistics and not waste time, use desc_stat_calc.py:
desc_stat_calc is capable of doing all the standard information provided in a descriptive statistics table, and will format the output for a direct copy-paste into the table.
